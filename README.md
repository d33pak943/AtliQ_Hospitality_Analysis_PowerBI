# AtliQ_Hospitality_Analysis_PowerBI
## Problem statment
In India, Atliq Grands is the owner of several five-star hotels. They have spent the last 20 years working in the hotel sector. The strategic actions made by rivals and poor managerial decision-making are causing Atliq Grands to lose market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment. In an attempt to recover market share and income, the managing director of Atliq Grands made the strategic decision to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence." They lack an internal data analytics team, though, therefore they are unable to get these insights.

The revenue management team made the decision to work with a third-party service provider to give them access to previous data insights.
## Task List
As a data analyst, I have been given sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following tasks. I will download all relevant documents from the download section and proceed with:

- Creating metrics according to the provided metric list.
- Building the dashboard based on the mock-up shared by stakeholders.
- Identifying and generating relevant insights beyond those mentioned in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

 ## Some Important insights from the Dashboard
- Mumbai generates the highest revenue (669 M) followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi
- AtliQ Exotica performs better compared to all 7 type of properties with 320 Million revenue, rating 3.62, occupancy percentage 57 and cancellation rate as 24.4%.
- AtliQ Bay has the highest occupancy of 66%
- Elite type rooms has the most booking and as well higher cancellation rate
- Week 24 recorded the highest revenue among all, which is 139.6 Million
- Delhi tops both in occupancy and rating followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore
- AtliQ lost around 298 Million in cancellation 

 ## Learnt things from this Project
- By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
- Learnt, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes.  
- Tried using color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard.
