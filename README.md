# AtliQ_Hospitality_Analysis_PowerBI
## Problem statment
In India, Atliq Grands is the owner of several five-star hotels. They have spent the last 20 years working in the hotel sector. The strategic actions made by rivals and poor managerial decision-making are causing Atliq Grands to lose market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment. In an attempt to recover market share and income, the managing director of Atliq Grands made the strategic decision to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence." They lack an internal data analytics team, though, therefore they are unable to get these insights.

The revenue management team made the decision to work with a third-party service provider to give them access to previous data insights.
## Task List
As a data analyst, I have been given sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following tasks. I will download all relevant documents from the download section and proceed with:

- Creating metrics according to the provided metric list.
- Building the dashboard based on the mock-up shared by stakeholders.
- Identifying and generating relevant insights beyond those mentioned in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
